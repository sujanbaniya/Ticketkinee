        Transaction Status
        “Transaction Status” means an indicator of stages in relation to the payment transaction. Transaction status can be Success, Pending, or Cancelled.
        
        Success status means the transaction has been completed, and Beneficiary Merchants or Bank account or eSewa account has received the transaction amount.
        
        Cancelled status means the transaction has been cancelled, and the transaction amount has been reverted or refunded back to the respective eSewa account.
        
        Pending status means the transaction is yet to be completed. Due to some technical or other issues at eSewa or Merchant or Bank, the transaction could be in a pending state. At pending state, the Beneficiary Merchants or Bank account or eSewa account might or might not receive the transaction amount. If a transaction status is indicated as “pending”, we advise the customer to contact eSewa as soon as possible to take further action. After analyzing the issue, eSewa will then change the status of the transaction to either success or canceled after verification.
        
        eSewa shall not be held liable for any liabilities resulted thereafter for the transaction in a pending state.
